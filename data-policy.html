                We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of 
                a particularly high priority for the management of Tower360 GmbH. The use of the Internet pages 
                of Tower360 GmbH is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject 
                wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become 
                necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such 
                processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
                <br>
                The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number 
                of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
                and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Tower360 GmbH. 
                By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public 
                of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, 
                data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which t
                hey are entitled.
                <br>
                As the controller, Tower360 GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational 
                measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. 
                However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute 
                protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal 
                data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

                Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. 
                A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which 
                Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was 
                stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of 
                the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser 
                can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

                Through the use of cookies, the Tower360 GmbH can provide the users of this website with more

            <div class="policy-text mt-3">
                By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. 
                Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this 
                recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, 
                e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over 
                by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system. Another example is the 
                cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer 
                has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

                The website of Tower360 GmbH collects a series of general data and information when a data

                used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website 
                (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) 
                an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.

            <div class="policy-text mt-3">
                When using these general data and information, Tower360 GmbH does not draw any conclusions about 
                the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website 
                correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the 
                long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide 
                law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a 
                cyber-attack. Therefore, the Tower360 GmbH analyzes anonymously collected data and information 
                statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, 
                and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of 
                the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

                On the website of Tower360 GmbH, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise’s 
                newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, 
                as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.

                The Tower360 GmbH informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a 
                newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received by the 
                data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject 
                registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address 
                registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, 
                in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.

                The newsletter of the Tower360 GmbH contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, Tower360 GmbH may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.

These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. Tower360 GmbH automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.

                    On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.

For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.

            </div>
            <div class="policy-text mt-3">     
                Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

                The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

            <div class="policy-text mt-3">       
                We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
